# Wordle Project

A Wordle-style game built with React + TypeScript as part of The Joy of React course.

## Description

In Wordle, players have 6 attempts to guess a secret 5-letter word. After each guess, the game provides colored feedback indicating which letters are correct and in the right position (ðŸŸ©), which letters are present but in the wrong position (ðŸŸ¨), and which letters are not in the word at all (â¬œ). The game ends after 6 incorrect guesses or when the player finds the correct word.
